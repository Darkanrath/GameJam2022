[NAME=???]Hello there...

Welcome to this world created by your subconscious.

[NAME=Depression]I am your depression, and I am here to give you a choice.

You have constantly been lazing around and refusing to get things done because of me.

Now you have the opportunity to change that and become an energetic and hard-working person.

If you choose to kill me then I'll disappear from your life...for now, but if you refuse then you will continue to trudge through life with me by your side.

What will your choice be?

**Choices** (Working on this...)

[CHOICE=1][*!1]
[*2]Kill them
[CHOICE=2][*!1]
Keep them alive
[CHOICE=3][*1]
Kill yourself

[1]Hope you enjoy your new self. I'll see you again sometime...

[2]Then let the cycle continue.

[3]Weirdo.
