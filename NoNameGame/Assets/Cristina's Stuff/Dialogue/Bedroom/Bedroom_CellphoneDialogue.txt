[NAME=NOEL]-Restless and anxious-

I think my resume was pretty good... I'm sure I don't have anything to worry about,

but all this waiting and the anticipation makes me nervous...

Eh, I'll be alright... Probably.

Hope I get a call soon...

...Or an email...

Maybe a fax?

Wait but I don't have a fax.
