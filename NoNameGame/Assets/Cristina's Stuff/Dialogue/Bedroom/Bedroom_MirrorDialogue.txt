[NAME=NOEL]-looks in the mirror and checks their messy clothes-

If I get this job I’m going to have to buy new clothes.

I got some savings leftover, so I should be good to buy better clothes.

With that job and the money I could make, I’ll be able to buy a new wardrobe...

...Then again, maybe keep it small.
