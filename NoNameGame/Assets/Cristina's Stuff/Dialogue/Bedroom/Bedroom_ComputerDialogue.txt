[NAME=NOEL]-Looks at the computer with a mixture of pride and apprehension-

I love my gaming PC. It's not the best, but definitely better than most. 

Usually I can play most games, and it distracts me from the horrible responsibilities of an adult.

Or at least it relaxes me...

... I wonder if I got any emails from that company??

-Checks email-

-sigh- Bummer, nothing yet...
