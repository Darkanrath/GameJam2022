... Hello! Thank you for letting me in earlier to deliver the food.

[NAME=Receptionist 1] Yeah! No problem hun. 

[NAME=Delivery Driver] Uhm. I was wondering if by any chance you knew if the company is hiring? 

Maybe an entry-level job, Security, Cleaning...?

[NAME=Receptionist 1] Sorry hun, we don't have any openings as far as I know.

You should check the website every now and then.

[NAME=Receptionist 2] Don't bother. They won't hire anytime soon.

[NAME=Delivery Driver] Oh... Ok, I totally understand.

But uhm... Would you be willing to take my resume? 

Maybe you can add it to your system for whenever a spot opens?

[NAME=Receptionist 1] Sure hun! We'll take it and I'll see what I can do.
