[NAME=Delivery Driver] -sigh- This traffic is messing me up... I need to get these deliveries faster if I want to make enough money. 

Maybe I have to work in delivery more than 8 hours a day?

I really need to pay my college debt and rent...

I wish everyone I deliver to would leave at least a $3 tip, I will not be this stressed otherwise.

... What did I do wrong in life to be here wishing for $3 tips... How did I get this bad.

-Attempts to check phone-

Ugh, there is no signal here. I should go outside to see how much the order total was...
