[NAME=Delivery Driver]-sigh- Traffic has been horrible today…

I don’t know what I can do to deliver faster, I will never make enough money if traffic keeps messing up my pickups and drop-offs.

Maybe I have to work in delivery more than 8 hours a day?

I really need to pay my college debt and rent.

I wish everyone I deliver to would leave at least $3 tip, I will not be this stressed otherwise… 

-sigh- what did I do wrong in life to wish for $3 tips… How did I get this bad.

-attempts to check phone-

Ugh, there is no signal here. I should go outside to see how much the order total was…
