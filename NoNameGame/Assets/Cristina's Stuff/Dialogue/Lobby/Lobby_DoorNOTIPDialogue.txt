[NAME=Delivery Driver]Why do I keep paying this company to not have service anywhere...

-phone starts ringing-

Hello? 

-mumble can be heard from the phone-

Oh no.. A-are you ok? 

-more mumble-

Ok, don't worry mom. I-I'll be on my way.

-hangs up-

I... I can't keep doing deliveries today... My mom is in a lot of pain.

Shit, rent is due today... I needed $20 extra from what I made so far...

...Unless?...

-checks delivery app-

I... I don't know what I expected.

I hope you forgive me, mom; I can't let them evict us... I hope you will be ok.

Just need to do a couple more deliveries... Please be ok.
