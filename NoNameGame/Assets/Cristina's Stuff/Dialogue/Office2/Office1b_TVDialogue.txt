"In a recent economic trend, employees are resigning en masse in what economists are calling 

“the Great Resignation”. Experts believe this is because of many workers reaching a breaking point

during the high workloads and other pressures that have been brought to light due to the pandemic.

In related news, recent college graduates are having a hard time paying off their student loan

debt due to low wages and lackluster recruiting effots by employers."
