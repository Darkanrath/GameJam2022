President of THECompany, 
I think we should downsize. What matters most is our profit margins and the investors. 
I’m sure that some of our soon to be ex-employees will have no problems finding other jobs. 
We would also save money spending less on payroll.
- Signed, Mr. CEO


[2][5]
President of THECompany,
I have a friend of mine that is perfect for a manager position. 
He’ll get the workers in-line and increase productivity. 
With this increase of productivity, profits should go back up in no time. 
- Signed, Mr. CEO  

[3][6]
President of THECompany,
I think we should hire some more personnel that could increase productivity. 
I have just the candidate in mind that I know is a hard worker. 
I understand profits are down but it is most likely just a down market altogether,
no reason to take drastic action. 
- Signed, Mr. CEO

[4][6]
President of THECompany,
I have a candidate for a position at our company. After reading their resume, 
I believe that they're just the new blood we need to revitalize the company and bring in new ideas. 
With these types of new hires, I believe that we could bring our company 
to the forefront of our market. 
- Signed, Mr. CEO
