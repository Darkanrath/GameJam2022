[NAME=VoiceMail]"You have one (1) new message"

[NAME=Assistant]"Hello Mr. CEO. HR left a message for you earlier.

They were inquiring about the applicant uhm... -paper rustles sound- Noel.

I was wondering if you could get back to them by the end of the day regarding a decision?

Feel free to contact them directly, or let me know so I can email the decision for you.

Thanks!"

[NAME=CEO]Oof, I almost forgot about it. Good thing she left a voicemail.

What would I do without her?

... But why they didn't just send an email?
