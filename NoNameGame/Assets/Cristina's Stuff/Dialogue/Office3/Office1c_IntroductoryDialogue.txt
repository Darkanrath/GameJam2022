[NAME=CEO]Ugh, I really hate meetings. Specially the ones that bring bad news.

Profits are down this quarter, I wonder how the president would react about this...

Not a great way to start a Monday to be honest.

Hum, maybe I should take the initiative and come up with a plan of action to present to the board...

Speaking of the board, maybe the president heard about todayâ€™s meeting. I should check my email.
