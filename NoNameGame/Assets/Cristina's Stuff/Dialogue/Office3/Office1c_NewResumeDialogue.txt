[NAME=CEO]-Looks at a resume-

The receptionist brought this to me.

She said that the 'kid' that gave it to her seemed to 'need a break'...

... Whatever that means.

I mean, it is... a decent resume. Not the best I have seen, but not the worst either. 

Hmmm... Wait a second. This name sounds... familiar?

-checks his phone-

Oh! Is this the delivery dude from earlier?

Wow. Kudos to them for trying. Maybe I'll think about it.
