[NAME=Nameplate]Reads "CEO".

[NAME=CEO]I have not been CEO for long, but I am glad my dad had some connections that landed me this position. 

Honestly, I think I am overqualified for it. I donâ€™t need the extra money, but if I make money for this company, I am sure eventually I will become the next president.

Come on, I have the knowledge, the charisma, I will get it. 

And the current president is old. I just need to be his right hand and make him happy.
