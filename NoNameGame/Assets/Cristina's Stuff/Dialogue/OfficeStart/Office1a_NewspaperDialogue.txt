[NAME=Newspaper Article]“UNEMPLOYMENT. The unemployment rate has increased significantly since the start of the pandemic. 

We talked with Dr. KnowItAll who explains that during these difficult times, there has been a rise in applications to work independently as food delivery drivers...

... since there are not enough jobs for everyone in the current market. These people work early mornings and late nights to provide for their family or themselves...

...which make them basically live from delivery-to-delivery.”

[NAME=CEO]-chuckle- Honestly, if they were smart, they would probably have a job. 

I am sure they are not trying hard enough. People nowadays complain so much.

They are probably spending their money on stupid stuff.
