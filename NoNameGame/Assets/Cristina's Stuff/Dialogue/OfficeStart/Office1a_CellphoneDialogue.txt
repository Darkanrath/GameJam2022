[NAME=CEO]-Browsing food choices- 

Hmmmmmm... my sophisticated palate is craving a tasty salmon... Shortcornet Steakhouse it is then.

Huh, I forgot they are far away. I do not want to waste my time driving without my chauffeur. 

Well, I can always order delivery right?

-using delivery app- My tasty salmon... Side of sweet potato fries... One liter diet coke... I can't wait!

-Error: Enter tip amount.-

What? I need to leave a tip? Ugh...

... I mean, $0.00 is an amount, right?

**Choices**

[CHOICE=1]Don't leave a tip.
[CHOICE=2][*1]
Leave a tip. 

[1] You know, I don't really care. Leaving a tip won't make a difference.

[2] -sigh- I did read in the newspaper that delivery drivers are struggling...
Maybe I should leave at least something. I hope this is enough.
