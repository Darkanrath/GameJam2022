[NAME=CEO]Ah… I think I have worked enough for the morning.

Maybe it is time to take my lunch break.

What should I get? Sushi… or some nice Salmon from ShortCornet Steakhouse…

Such a hard decision, this is exhausting.

-sighs- One hour isn't enough. Maybe I should declare a three-hour lunch mandate.

Better check my phone to decide now.
