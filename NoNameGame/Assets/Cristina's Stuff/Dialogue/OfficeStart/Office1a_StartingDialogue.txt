[NAME=CEO]Ah… I think I have worked enough for the day. Maybe it is time to take my lunch break.

I don’t know if I should get Sushi… or some nice Salmon from ShortCornet Steakhouse… 

Such a hard decision, this is exhausting. -sighs-

I should make a new rule: three-hour lunch break for the CEO. I am sure people will love it.

Better order from my phone before they give me any more work.
